## Why Gemini Watch?

Most AI assistants on Apple Watch are thin mirrors of an iPhone app — they require your phone nearby, re-route requests through a companion, or don't support streaming. **Gemini Watch runs entirely on watchOS**: it calls the Google Gemini API directly over Wi-Fi or cellular, streams tokens as they arrive, and stores every conversation locally on the watch.

If you're looking for a **native Apple Watch Gemini client**, a **lightweight LLM chat app for watchOS**, or a **SwiftUI reference implementation of the Gemini streaming API**, this project is for you.

---

## Features

- **Real-time Streaming Chat** — Tokens appear as Gemini generates them, with an animated typing cursor. Built on Server-Sent Events (SSE) from the Gemini streaming endpoint.
- **Full Conversation History** — Every chat is saved as an individual JSON file on the watch and browsable from a scrollable list. Swipe any conversation to delete it; pin important chats to the top.
- **Message Editing & Regeneration** — Long-press any user message to edit it and regenerate Gemini's reply from that point.
- **Web Search Grounding** — Enable Gemini's `google_search` tool from Settings to get grounded answers with inline citations and source links.
- **Context-Aware Quick Replies** — Smart suggestion chips appear after each response, tailored to the content (code, lists, follow-up questions, or general conversation). Toggleable from Settings.
- **Markdown & LaTeX Rendering** — Code blocks with language labels, bold and italic text, inline math (`$…$`) and block math (`$$…$$`), powered by a pre-compiled regex parser with result caching for smooth scrolling.
- **Text-to-Speech** — Tap any Gemini response to hear it spoken aloud via `AVSpeechSynthesizer`, with a Slow / Normal / Fast speech-rate slider.
- **Adjustable Creativity (Temperature)** — A Precise → Balanced → Creative → Wild slider maps directly to the Gemini `temperature` parameter (0.0–1.0), with a one-tap reset to the default.
- **Haptic Feedback** — Optional haptics on key interactions; toggleable in Settings.
- **Double Tap Gesture Support** — Use the watchOS Double Tap gesture (Apple Watch Series 9, 10, and Ultra 2) to open the input field instantly.
- **Action Button Integration (Apple Watch Ultra)** — Press the Action button, speak your question, and get Gemini's reply as text on screen — no app UI, no voice output. Powered by an `AppIntent` you wire up once in the Shortcuts app. See [Action Button Setup](#action-button-setup-apple-watch-ultra).
- **Customizable System Prompt** — Edit Gemini's persona, tone, and instructions right from the in-app Settings screen, with a reset-to-default button.
- **Live Model Picker** — Switch between available Gemini models (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-pro`). The list is fetched live from the Gemini API and filtered to text-capable models.
- **Clear All Chats** — One-tap bulk delete with a confirmation dialog in the Settings "Danger Zone".
- **40mm / 41mm Optimized** — Compact typography, tight spacing, and carefully tuned tap targets designed for the smallest Apple Watch screens.
- **100% On-Device Storage** — Conversations never leave your watch except when sent to the Gemini API itself.

## Usage Guide

### Chat basics

- **Start a new chat** — Tap the compose button from the conversation list.
- **Send a message** — Tap the input field, dictate or scribble, and press send.
- **Regenerate a reply** — Long-press any of your own messages, edit, and resend.
- **Hear a reply aloud** — Tap any Gemini message to trigger text-to-speech.
- **Delete a conversation** — Swipe left on it in the conversation list.

### Settings

Open **Settings** from the conversation list to configure:

| Setting | What it does |
|---|---|
| **AI Model** | Picker of Gemini models your API key can access (e.g. `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-pro`). Fetched live from the API. |
| **Speech → Speed** | Text-to-speech rate — Slow, Normal, or Fast. |
| **Creativity** | Maps to the Gemini `temperature` parameter (0.0–1.0). Labels: Precise, Balanced, Creative, Wild. Includes a **Reset to Default** button (0.7). |
| **Haptics** | Toggle haptic feedback on interactions. |
| **Quick Replies** | Toggle the context-aware suggestion chips that appear after each response. |
| **Web Search** | Toggle grounded answers with citations via Gemini's `google_search` tool. |
| **System Prompt** | Multiline editor for the assistant's persona and instructions. Includes a **Reset to Default** button. |
| **Clear All Chats** | Danger-zone action with a confirmation dialog — permanently deletes every saved conversation from the watch. |

## Action Button Setup (Apple Watch Ultra)

Gemini Watch exposes an **`AskGeminiIntent`** ([App Intents](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appintents)) that takes a spoken question and returns Gemini's reply as **plain text — never spoken aloud**. Wire it to the Action button once, and every press becomes: *talk → text reply on screen*, without opening the app.

### One-time setup

1. Install/update Gemini Watch on your Apple Watch Ultra (or Ultra 2) at least once so the system indexes its App Intents.
2. On the watch, open the **Shortcuts** app (or build the shortcut on your iPhone in the Shortcuts app under the **Watch** tab — it syncs to the watch).
3. Create a new shortcut with these steps, in order:
   - **Dictate Text** — captures your spoken question with the watch mic.
   - **Ask Gemini** (search for it under Gemini Watch's actions) — pass the **Dictated Text** output into its **Question** parameter.
   - **Show Result** — pass the **Ask Gemini** output in, so the reply is displayed as text on screen.
4. Name the shortcut (e.g. "Ask Gemini") and save it.
5. On the watch, open **Settings → Action Button**, swipe to **Shortcut**, and pick the shortcut you just created.

Now: **press and hold the Action button → speak your question → the text reply appears on screen.**

> Shortcuts also lets you skip step 3's manual build: Gemini Watch registers "Ask Gemini" as an App Shortcut, so it should already appear in the Shortcuts app gallery, ready to assign directly to the Action button. If you assign it without a Dictate Text step, the system will prompt you to speak your question when the shortcut runs.

### Notes

- Runs **headless** — the intent does not open the Gemini Watch UI, so it stays fast and doesn't interrupt whatever you were doing.
- Every question and answer is also saved into a rolling **"Quick Ask (Action Button)"** conversation, viewable later from the normal conversation list.
- Uses whatever **Model**, **System Prompt**, **Creativity**, and **Web Search** settings are currently configured in the app's Settings screen.
- Requires the same `Secrets.plist` / `GEMINI_API_KEY` setup as the rest of the app — see [Installation & Setup](#installation--setup).

## Architecture

Gemini Watch follows a lean MVVM architecture built entirely in SwiftUI. There is no Core Data, no Combine-heavy plumbing, and no third-party dependencies — just `URLSession`, `FileManager`, and `AVFoundation`.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `gemini_watchApp.swift` | App entry point — launches `ConversationListView`. |
| `ConversationListView.swift` | Browsable conversation list with swipe-to-delete. |
| `ContentView.swift` | Main chat UI — input bar, messages, suggestion chips. |
| `ChatViewModel.swift` | Message state, streaming orchestration, auto-persistence, debounced UI updates. |
| `GeminiService.swift` | Gemini API client — streaming SSE chat and model listing. |
| `MessageView.swift` | Message bubble with markdown rendering, streaming cursor, and TTS trigger. |
| `MarkdownParser.swift` | Pre-compiled regex parser for code blocks, math, and inline styling; result-cached. |
| `Models.swift` | `Message`, `Conversation`, and `AppSettings` data types. |
| `PersistenceManager.swift` | File-based storage (one JSON file per conversation) with UserDefaults migration. |
| `SettingsView.swift` | Model picker, speech rate, haptics, quick replies, system prompt editor. |
| `Speaker.swift` | Text-to-speech wrapper around `AVSpeechSynthesizer`. |
| `AppSettingsStore.swift` | Observable store for user preferences. |
| `Branding.swift` | Shared colors, gradients, and typography tokens. |
| `AskGeminiIntent.swift` | `AppIntent` powering the Action button / Shortcuts flow — headless question → text reply, plus the `AppShortcutsProvider` registration. |

### Data flow

```
User input → ChatViewModel → GeminiService (streaming SSE)
                    ↓                       ↓
           PersistenceManager        MessageView (token-by-token UI)
                    ↓
          One JSON file per chat
```

## Privacy & Data Handling

- **Conversations are stored locally** on the Apple Watch as JSON files in the app's sandboxed container.
- **Messages are transmitted only to the Google Gemini API** over HTTPS when you send a request.
- **No analytics, telemetry, or third-party SDKs** are bundled.
- **Your API key stays on the device** in `Secrets.plist`, embedded in the app bundle at build time.

Review [Google's Gemini API data usage policy](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms) to understand how Google handles prompts and responses on their side.

## FAQ

### Does Gemini Watch require an iPhone?

No. Gemini Watch is a **standalone watchOS app**. As long as your Apple Watch has a network connection (Wi-Fi or cellular), it can talk to Gemini without an iPhone nearby.

### Is Gemini Watch free?

Yes — the app is MIT-licensed and free. You only pay Google for any API usage above their free Gemini tier.

### Which Apple Watch models are supported?

Any Apple Watch running **watchOS 11 or later**. The layout is tuned for 40mm and 41mm cases but scales up to 44mm, 45mm, 49mm (Ultra), and 42mm/46mm Series 10.

### Can I use a different model, like `gemini-2.5-pro`?

Yes. Open **Settings → Model** to pick from any model your API key has access to. The list is fetched live from the Gemini API.

### Does it support images, voice input, or vision?

The current release focuses on text chat with text-to-speech output. Voice input uses the standard watchOS dictation / Scribble input methods, or the Action button flow below. Vision and multimodal support are on the roadmap.

### Can I use the Apple Watch Ultra Action button to talk to Gemini?

Yes. See [Action Button Setup](#action-button-setup-apple-watch-ultra). Press and hold the Action button, speak your question, and Gemini's reply appears as **text on screen** — it is never spoken aloud, and the app UI never has to open.

### Does Gemini Watch support web search?

Yes. Flip the **Web Search** toggle in Settings to enable Gemini's `google_search` grounding tool. Responses that use web results include inline citations with source URLs.

### Can I tune how creative the responses are?

Yes. The **Creativity** slider in Settings maps directly to the Gemini `temperature` parameter from 0.0 (Precise) to 1.0 (Wild). Tap **Reset to Default** to return to 0.7.

### How do I back up my conversations?

Conversations live in the app's sandbox on the watch. They'll be included in encrypted iCloud backups of your paired iPhone if you have that enabled.

### Does it work offline?

The UI and your saved history work offline, but sending new messages requires a network connection to reach the Gemini API.

### Is this an official Google product?

No. Gemini Watch is an **unofficial, community-built** open-source client. "Gemini" and "Google" are trademarks of Google LLC.
